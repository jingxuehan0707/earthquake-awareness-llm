# Earthquake Awareness with LLM

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a project built using the [ReAct Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629) in combination with the OpenAI API, ArcGIS World Geocoding Service, and USGS real-time earthquake feeds. 

By integrating GPT-4 with external APIs, this project bridges the fields of Large Language Models (LLMs), Geographic Information Systems (GIS), and natural hazard risk analysis. It showcases the potential for interdisciplinary research and real-world applications, unlocking new opportunities for impactful solutions.
